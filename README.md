## PLY

PLY, which stands for "Python Lex-Yacc", is a set of tools for building lexical analyzers (lexers) and parsers (parsers) in Python. These tools are designed to provide developers with the capability to construct language processors, compilers, and interpreters. PLY is inspired by the Lex and Yacc tools used in the C programming language.

### Use Cases

1. **Compiler Construction:** PLY is often used for implementing compilers, transforming source code into machine-readable code.
2. **Interpreter Development:** It can be employed to build interpreters for custom languages.
3. **Language Processing Tools:** PLY is versatile and can be used for various language processing tasks where lexical analysis and parsing are required.

### Lexical Analysis (Lex) in PLY

The lex module in PLY is responsible for the lexical analysis of the input source code. It is used to define rules for recognizing and tokenizing elements such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, and operators.

### Parser (Yacc) in PLY

The yacc module in PLY is utilized for parsing the tokenized input generated by the lex module. It helps define the grammar rules of the language and constructs a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) based on the input source code.

When implementing a language processor using PLY, the lex and yacc components work in conjunction to handle both lexical analysis and parsing:

1. **Lexical Analysis (Lex):**
   - Tokenizes the input source code.
   - Identifies and categorizes individual elements using regular expressions and rules.
   - Returns a sequence of tokens.

2. **Parsing (Yacc):**
   - Takes the sequence of tokens produced by the lex module.
   - Implements grammar rules to recognize the structure of the code.
   - Constructs a parse tree or AST representing the syntactic structure of the code.

The integration of lex and yacc in PLY allows developers to build powerful language processors, compilers, and interpreters.

### Example Integration:

```python
from ply import lex, yacc

# Lex rules (as mentioned previously)

# Yacc rules for a simple expression grammar
def p_expression(p):
    '''expression : expression PLUS term
                  | expression MINUS term
                  | term'''
    # Implementation of parsing logic

def p_term(p):
    '''term : term TIMES factor
            | term DIVIDE factor
            | factor'''
    # Implementation of parsing logic

def p_factor(p):
    '''factor : NUMBER
              | LPAREN expression RPAREN'''
    # Implementation of parsing logic

# Build the lexer and parser
lexer = lex.lex()
parser = yacc.yacc()

# Test the parser with input code
result = parser.parse("2 + 3 * (4 - 1)")

# Process the parse result as needed
print(result)
```

This example illustrates the integration of lex and yacc components to create a simple parser for arithmetic expressions. The lex module tokenizes the input, and the yacc module defines grammar rules to parse the token sequence and produce a result.

### Files

- **main.py:** This file serves as an example demonstrating the usage of the lex module inside the PLY package. It showcases the implementation of rules for recognizing keywords, identifiers, numbers, strings, comments, operators, and other elements in a programming language.

### How to Run

To run the lexer example, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install PLY by running:
   ```bash
   pip install ply
   ```

3. Execute the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
